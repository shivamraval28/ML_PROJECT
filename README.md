# ML_PROJECT
Object Detection based on Mask R-CNN 

In this project, I tried to achieve mask of the object using pre-trained COCO model by providing bounding box input. Among all the techniques namely Region Bases Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN), Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, Single Shot Detector (SSD), and YOLO (You Only Look Once), I am going to applying Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation on the dataset. I have chosen Mask R-CNN because of having higher accuracy rates as well as better performance. I have trained the model 10 times to get much as accuracy as possible. My model successfully achieved 70% accuracy.

The project is an application based on the work that has been done on Mask R-CNN where the model source code was pre-trained on FPN and ResNet101 and also has the pre-trained weights for MS COCO adn the training code for MS COCO. The below URL provides the location of the algorithm.
